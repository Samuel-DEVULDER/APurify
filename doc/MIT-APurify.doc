DESCRIPTION (SHORT):
--------------------
    This is APurify for compilers with MIT syntax asm-files. As  far  as  I
    know only GCC uses such a syntax. So that version is indeed  a  version
    for the GCC compiler. If you are using an  other  compiler,  then  read
    MOT-APurify instead. In the following of that document, APurify  stands
    for MIT-APurify, and I assume you're using the GCC compiler.

    APurify is a program that allows you to detect bad accesses  to  memory
    of your programs without any kind of specific external  devices  (MMU).
    It avoids bugs due to accessing memory not owned by your program.

    New things are labeled with a *NEW* mark.

INSTALLATION:
------------
	That archive contains the version of APurify for the  GCC  compiler
    as well for other compilers. Here is a description of gcc-related files
    of this archive for that version. It also gives you  what  to  do  with
    those files to make an installation.

	- doc/MIT-APurify.doc	The file you are currently  reading. Put it
				with all your doc files. It is usefull from
				time to time.

	- doc/History		The whole history.  (this  file is not very
				usefull for common people). Do whatever you
				want with it.

	- bin/MIT-APurify	The parser tuned for the MIT syntax. Rename
				it as APurify and put it someware  in  your
				path (provided you do not want to use APF).

				If you wish to use APF (read  APF.doc)  you
				just need to copy that	file  somewhere  in
				your path (ie. do not rename it).

	- lib/libAPur-gcc.a	The link-time library.	Rename it as APur.a
				and  put  it  someware	in   your   library
				search-path.

				If  you   wish	 to   use   APF   (strongly
				recommended), just put that  file  in  your
				LIB: directory. APF will expect it in  that
				place.

	- test/test.c		Source of a stupid test file.  Just here to
				let  you  remake  the  test   program.	 Do
				whatever you want with it.

	- test/test.gcc 	Test file  Apurify'ed.  Run it  to  see how
				APurify is useful :-).

	If you don't want to mess with all those files, you had rather  use
    the included Installer script. It will handle  evrything  for  you	and
    generate an script that will uninstall APurify,  but  you  wouldn't  do
    that :-).


SYNOPSIS:
--------
    Usage: APurify [-revinfo] <inputfile> [options]

    Where options can be:

	?		: To display this usage
	-o file 	: specifies output file (def="%s")
	-tb		: enable base register testing
	-ts		: enable stack register testing
	-tl		: enable local stack frame testing
	-tp		: to test pea instruction
	-sl source name : to use source level informations
	-br An		: sets the base register (def="A4")
	-mp main label	: sets the main label (def="_main")

    Options can be anywhere on the command line. NOTE: They can  nomore  be
    merged together, they must be separated by a space. You  can pre-define
    them with the environment variable AP_MITP_OPT. For example, if you do:

	CLI> SetEnv AP_MITP_OPT "-tb -br A5"

    Then, when "-tb -br A5" will automatically  be  added  to  the  command
    line. The space between an option and its argument can be ommited. Thus
    "-br A4" is the same as "-brA4". Here is a description of arguments and
    flags:

    ?		Obvious options.

    -revinfo	This displays informations  about APurify  (name,  size and
		date of modules and number of  compilation  done  for  that
		version).

    -o arg	This specifies the name of the outputfile. If  ommited	the
		outputfile will be the same as the inputfile (source file).
		The name of the output file can be defined by a  real  name
		or a pattern. A pattern is a string where special sequences
		of characters (called specifier) are  replaced  by  special
		strings. Let's suppose that inputfile is equal to

			    drive:path/file.ext

		Here is a description of specifiers:

		    %s	will be replaced by the full source name:

			    drive:path/file.ext

		    %S	will expand to the  full  source name  without	the
			extension:

			    drive:path/file

		    %b	stands for the full basename:

			    file.ext

		    %B	is a shortcut for the  full  basename  without	the
			extension:

			    file

		    %p	is the path (ending "/" or ":" is included):

			    drive:path/

		    %e	is the extension ("." is ommited):

			    ext

		Thus, if you put "-o ram:%B-apurify.%e" in the commandline,
		then the outputfile  will  be  "ram:file-apurify.ext"  with
		our example.

    -tb 	This enable APurify to check all referenced  memory through
		the base register (see -br). If you are using a  SMALL_DATA
		model, add this flag on  your  command	line.  By  default,
		APurify won't check  memory  referenced  through  the  base
		register.

		NOTE: for safest check, you should always use that  option,
		even if you're not in smalldata model (A4 may  be  used  as
		a temporary register in that case). To allow this, you	can
		use the environment variable.

    -ts 	This  enable  APurify to  check memory referenced  by stack
		pointer (SP or A7). By default  APurify  won't  check  such
		memory accesses (to reduce the code size and  increase  the
		runtime speed). That option will detect when  you  have  no
		more room on your stack (stack overflow).

    -tl 	This enable APurify to check  memory  referenced   by local
		stack pointer (the one that is link'ed and  unlink'ed  when
		enterring and exiting a C-function). By  default,  this  is
		switched off. This option allow  APurify  to  detect  stack
		overflow.

    -tp 	This enable APurify to check indirect  adresses pushed onto
		the stack by using a pea. By  default  this  is  off.  When
		used, that option will check things like "pea  a2@(10)"  or
		the like. This can help  you  with  memory  accessed  by  a
		pointer in a code that has not been APurify'ed. For example
		this is usefull  for  things  like  fread(&ptr[10],10,1,fp)
		because in that case the "pea a2@(10)" used to push on  the
		stack &ptr[10] will be checked and if ptr[10] is not  owned
		by your program, you'll get an APurify error.  Please  note
		that this may no work all the time  since  &ptr[0]  can  be
		translated as "movel a0,sp@-" which  won't be checked.

    -sl  file	By  using this option, you tell apurify to use source-level
		information. File must be the fullname of the C file  (path
		included). To use this option you must	compile  with  'gcc
		-g'. I suggest you not to use this option by  yourself  and
		let APF handle everything automatically.

    -br arg	This  sets  the  base  register  used  to  reference memory
		in SMALL_DATA model. Usually A4 is used  for  that  perpose
		and that's the default. If A5  is  used  instead  then  add
		-brA5 on your command line.

    -mp arg	This tells APurify which label should be considered as	the
		entry-point. By default it is set to "_main", and it should
		not be modified.


DESCRIPTION (A BIT LONGER):
--------------------------
	As a general rule, at the microprocessor level, there is  two  kind
    of ways to access memory. There is direct access and indirect access to
    memory. For example, in C, direct access can be viewed as accessing  to
    global variables. Indirect access corresponds  to  accessing  an  array
    value. More precisely, direct access corresponds to reading or  writing
    a variable whose address is known at compilation  time  (or  since  the
    loading of the program into the memory). Indirect access  is  used	for
    variables whose adress is dynamicaly determined  by  the  program.	For
    example, if p is a pointer to an array allocated by malloc(), *p is  an
    indirect access. Such an access occur also in case of instruction  like
    T[i] where T is a global array, because the  address  of  T[i]  is	not
    known at compilation time, since it depends on the index value i. Using
    indirect access to memory is called indirection.

	A regular program must not access memory not owned by it. That kind
    of access can be qualified as illegal.

	Illegal direct access  to   memory  is	not  possible, because	 by
    definition, only global  variables can be  accessed that  way and those
    variables belongs obviously to the program	(except for code written in
    assembly   language   that	references  absolute   values, for example:
    "btst  #6,$bfe001"; but that  kind of  code  is not a  good programming
    :-)). So we can assume that direct access to memory is always right.

	On the other hand,  it is sure	that indirect access to  memory can
    be illegal.  Many bugs are made by	overstepping array  boundaries.  If
    that oversteppings are  in reading a value, there  is not much  trouble
    for over running tasks (it is an error inside your  task); but if it is
    in writing you may directly interfere with other tasks and big mess can
    happen (total breakdown of the system).

	APurify works on  that kind of access  by verifying the validity of
    indirect access to memory. It remebers the memory that was allocated by
    the program and check the integrity of  each access. One can think that
    makes a lot of tests ! Well, yes, but APurify is  not  designed  to  be
    used in the general use of programs; just  in  test  phases.  Moreover,
    indirections  do  no  occur  very  often  actually.  Only	array-based
    variables produces indirections.  Thus,  the  variables  on  the  stack
    --although being accessed by  indirection--  are  not  checked  because
    their access is always safe (at least if there is no stack overflow !).
    Also, in SMALL_DATA model, global  variables  access  is  done  through
    indirection, but they are not checked.

	If an illegal access is found, APurify displays an error message on
    the error stream of the program  by  default.  There  is  two  kind  of
    illegal accesses. Some are accesses to memory that	doesn't  belong  to
    the program (it is called an access between blocks),  some  others  are
    accesses to a part of memory owned by a program and an other  part	not
    owned by it (it is an overstepping  of  a  block).  You  can  see  this
    visually: If [ 1 ] and [ 2 ] represent  two  blocks  allocated  by	the
    program and ( 3 ) the memory accessed, then

		 ---- [ 1 ] ---- ( 3 ) ---- [ 2 ] ---->
		0				       increasing address

    corresponds to the first kind of illegal access and

		     ---- [ 1 ( ] 3 ) ---- [ 2 ] ----->
    or
		     ---- [ 1 ] ---- ( 3 [ ) 2 ] ----->

    corresonds to the second kind of access. The first kind is very  common
    but the second is quite rare (it's rather a misaligment problem).

	APurify has two output modes. One is verbose an tries to  give	lot
    of informations by using words. The other one is more brief  and  gives
    you the same informations but you'll have to decode them.

	When APurify starts and ends, it outputs  the  date/time.  This  is
    useful if you are using logfiles. With that, you can keep all your logs
    in a  single  file	and  retrieve  any  execution  with  it's  date  of
    execution.

	In case of error, APurify displays some text. The first line  looks
    like this one:

	**** APURIFY ERROR ! [0x<N1>(<N2>) <ATTR> (<TEXT1>)] <TEXT2>:

    That line represent  the  accessed	memory.  <N1>  is  the	hexadecimal
    address accessed. <N2> is the length of the access (in decimal). <ATTR>
    represents the type of acess. <TEXT1> allows you to find where in  your
    code the illegal accessed had happened. <TEXT2> describe  the  kind  of
    illegal access. The prefix "0x" can  be  replaced  by  the  content  of
    ENV:APDOLL (for example '$' if you prefer asm-style).
    illegal access.

	If the length (<N1>) is 1, then it was a byte access. 2 stands  for
    a short access,  4	for  a	int/long  and  >4  for	movem  instruction.
    Attributes, <ATTR>, can be "R---" or "-W--". The first  one  represents
    an access in reading a value and the second  an  access  in  writing  a
    value.

	The text <TEXT1> look like this:

	    <NAME>, PC=0x<PC#> HUNK=0x<HUNK#> OFFSET=0x<OFF#>

    <NAME> is the name of the subroutine where the  error  occured.  It  is
    always displayed (even if it is a "static" one). The rest of  the  line
    can be partially displayed, showing as much informations as APurify can
    get. <PC#> is a hexadecimal address pointing to  the  instruction  that
    produced the error. <HUNK#> and <OFF#> are	the  hunk  number  and	the
    relative offset of <PC#>. Using <HUNK#> and <OFF#> and a  disassembler,
    you can very easilly find where your code is bad (BTW, I use dobj  from
    netdcc, (c) by Matt Dillon). Please note  that  in  this  new  version,
    <PC#> will nomore point to some instruction before the faultly one.  It
    is always the real faultly adress.

	When '-sl' is used, <TEXT1> is a bit longer. Before <NAME> you  can
    find a filename and a line number (<FILE>.c:<NUMBER>). That  gives  you
    in the code where the faultly access has occured.

	The remaining lines show the context  of  the  illegal	access.  It
    gives you informations about the  surronding  memory  blocks  owned  by
    your program. Each	block  is  displayed  according  to  the  following
    pattern:

		       [0x<N1>(<N2>) <ATTR> (<TEXT>)]

    where <N1> is the hexadecimal address of the beginning  of	the  block,
    <N2> its length (in decimal). Note that  the  length  may  seem  to  be
    longer than the one allocated by malloc() and  the  address  may  point
    before the one you obtained via malloc(). This is not wrong !  In  fact
    you must know that the malloc() subroutine may  add  some  informations
    (like an double-chained list or the length of the  allocation)  to  the
    block you've requested. Those extra informations  are  put  before  the
    address you recieve. That explain this behavior.  In  this	version  of
    APur.lib, this takes 12 (0xC)  extra  bytes.  So  if  you  allocate  10
    bytes, don't be suprised if APurify thinks you've requested 22 bytes.

	<ATTR> are 4 status characters RWSF

	where R means: read-enable block
	      W means: write-enable block
	      S means: system block (block not controlled by the program).
	      F means: freed block (a block that is freed bye FreeMem()).

    If one access is forbidden, the letter '-' replaces  the  corresponding
    character. <TEXT> is actually  the	name  of  the  procedure  that	has
    allocated the block.

	With each block you can find an offset. That offset is the distance
    between that block and the faultly address. In verbose  mode,  you	can
    see some text explaining things about the relative position of a  block
    and the accessed memory. In non-verbose  mode  you	can  just  see	the
    offsets followed by the blocks. The shorter offset is  displayed  first
    since that block is the one that is more likely overstepped.

	When an illegal writing occur (the only dangerous thing you can  do
    by indirection, indeed), a requester opens to tell you about that. With
    that requester, you can stop your program to prevent the  deadly  error
    to really happen. If you wish  so,	exit()  is  called.  You  can  also
    ignore that error or ignore all such errors  (but  then  you'll  surely
    meet the guru !). If you want the requester to pop on  a special screen 
    (say "GOLDED.1"), then *NEW* use
			SetEnv APscreen "GOLDED.1"
    to tell APurify to use "GOLDED.1" as screen.

	APurify checks the memory allocated and *NEW* freed by the program.
    Now, if you  access  a  pointer  that  you	have  freed,  APurify  will
    complain. It'll also complain if you attempt to free twice an allocated
    block. It'll display non deallocated-blocks on library-closing time.

	It  knows  about  memory  location  independant  of   the   program
    execution. That is to say, the first kilobyte of memory  that  contains
    interrupt vectors of the 680x0 processor, the program segments and	the
    stack. Accessing to those blocks  will  be	illegal.  They	got  the  S
    attribute (for SYSTEM blocks).

	It takes into  account	memory	block  allocated  by  malloc()  and
    AllocMem(), and indirect allocated block (by OpenScreen() for example).
    But I did not test the last kind of allocation. Anyway,  it  should  be
    ok, because APurify patches AllocMem()  &  FreeMem()  entries.  Thus  a
    program can access to the bitplanes of one of its screen without error.

	If  the  program  makes  a  legal  access,   but   attributes	are
    incompatible  with	the  access-kind,  a  protection-error	message  is
    displayed. Actually only the first	kilobyte  is  read/write-protected.
    But it may change in the future.


HOW TO USE APURIFY:
------------------
	One can see APurify as a pre-assembler. It must be used on assembly
    language sourcefile just before the assembler takes place. It scan	the
    file and change it a bit so that APur.a can be used.

	Normal way to use it for a C program is to:

	- compile C sourcefiles and leave assembly language source (.s).
	- use APurify on each .s file.
	- compile your .s file to get a .o file
	- link all .o files together with APur.a.

    For example, using gcc on prog.c it gives

	CLI> gcc -g prog.c -o prog.s -S
	CLI> APurify -tb prog.s
	CLI> gcc -g prog.s -o prog -lAPur

	As you can see, APurify needs no change to your C files to be used.
    In this realease you need no more  to  call  AP_Init()  in  the  main()
    function. The call is automatically inserted when the main-entry  label
    (specified by -mp) is found. You shoud not  use  dos.library/Exit()  to
    abort your program, I think it'll crash if APurify is running.  If  you
    must use Exit() then call AP_Close() just before  calling  Exit().  The
    explantion is simple: since some system functions  are  patched,  if  a
    program  exits  without  closing  the  library,  those  patch  will  be
    corruped, pointing to a code that is nomore in memory and  you'll  meet
    the guru (ie: the computer will crash)... (You've been warned :-).

	You can disable/enable printing of messages by	making	a  call  to
    AP_Report(flag). If  flag  is  true  (ie.  different  from  zero)  then
    printing is enabled, if it is false (ie. equal to zero), no output will
    be done. This is usefull for startup-codes. For  example,  if  you	are
    using the argv[] array in C,  APurify  will  make  a lot of false-error
    printing. This is because the values pointed by this array is allocated
    before  the  library   is	opened.   You  can avoid  this	by  calling
    AP_Report(0) before (and AP_Report(1) after) the code that uses argv[].

	When debugging an APurify'ed program, you can put a  breakpoint  on
    a function called AP_Err(). That function AP_Err() is called each  time
    APurify detects an error. With that, you'll have the occasion  to  look
    at your program just before a faultly memory-access occur.

	You can also use  the  enviroment  variable  "APexec"  to  call  an
    external  process  when  AP_Err()  is  called,  provided   source-level
    information are available (see '-sl'). With that feature, you can  call
    your favorite editor when an error is detected. For example, if you do

	    CLI> Setenv APexec "Memacs $source goto $line"

    then in case of error, APurify will call Memacs on the source file	and
    will put the cursor on the line that caused the error. Before executing
    the string contained in  env:APexec,  APurify  will  do  the  following
    substitutions:

	    $SOURCE    <=> source of the file
	    $LINE      <=> line in the source where the error had occured
	    $BUGNO     <=> the number of APurify-hit found so far.
	    $CALLCHAIN <=> the history of function calls.

    You can call a shell-script by this process and use $BUGNO to call	the
    editor after a certain number of APurify-hit are found. If the executed
    process returns an error code different from zero, APurify will abort()
    your program. I know this is quite rudimentary, but it is  better  than
    nothing ;-) This mecanism is used in the scripts located in the  AREXX/
    directory (read Scripts.doc for more information about them).

	You can switch	from  a  verbose  output  to  a  shorter  one  with
    AP_Verbose(flag). IF flag is true then the verbose mode is on. If it is
    false then only short messages will be printed. Some people prefer	the
    later so that is the default. If you perfer the verbose ouput then	put
    AP_Verbose(1)  someware  in  your  code  and  you'll  get  some  longer
    explanations about illegal accesses.

	You can specify a logfile where APurify can put its errors.  To  do
    this, set the environment variable "APlog" (file ENV:APlog) to  a  name
    of a logfile. If this variable is set, then APurify will append all its
    outputs to the file indicated. If this variable does not  exists,  then
    the standard error stream is used.

	With  the  help  of  APF  all  this  boring  stuff  will  be   done
    automatically. Read APF.doc for further information.


EXAMPLE:

	As an example,	let's  look  at  the  test  program  compiled  with
    gcc-2.7.2. You'll see how you can use the APurify report it produces to
    find what's wrong in the program.  For  this,  I've  included  in  that
    document the commented report.  My comments/explanations appear between

    As you can see, APurify and Enforcer agree. But APurify does  a  better
    job because it discovers more bugs.


LEGAL PART:
----------
	That program is provided 'AS IS'. I  am  not  responsible  for  any
    dammage it can cause (but I am responsible for the benefits it can give
    to you :-). Use that software at your own risks.

	That program is FREEWARE. You can use and distribute it as long  as
    you keep the archive  intact  (no  adulteration  of  files  except  for
    compression). It can't be sold without my agreement (except  a  minimal
    amount for media support). You must ask me for commercial use  of  (any
    part of) that product. I keep all my rights on  that  program  and	its
    future releases. I can modify that software without telling it  to	the
    users.

	If you wish, you can send me a postcard or anything else  you  want
    (money, documentation, amiga, hardware  stuff,  ...)  in  exchange  for
    using APurify. But there is no obligation :-). My postal address is:

    (yes I'm french !). You can  send  suggestions  or  bugs  to  my  email
    address:

NOTES:
-----
	I had the idea of that program	after  a  chat	with  Cedric  BEUST
    (AMIGA NEWS) on IRC (Internet Relay Chat). Thanks Cedric !

	I wish to thank Philippe Brand for his help in my port. I also wish
    to thank J.C Hoehle for his usefull advices.

	All marks are proprietary of their respective owners.

	There are some programs like APurify. For example,  FORTIFY  (Simon
    P. Bullen), but  it  only  detects	illegal  writes  to  boundaries  of
    allocated blocks. Thus it can't detect big oversteps and  oversteps  in
    reading and the detection is not real-time. Enforcer can detect illegal
    access to memory, but it needs a special device (MMU).


HINTS & TIPS:
------------
	You can see some memory leaks with that version of APurify.  It  is
    not really good but it can help. Memory leak  occur  when  a  block  of
    memory is nomore pointed by your  program.	Those  memory  blocks  will
    necessary be displayed when your  program  exit()s.  So  with  all  the
    messages printed on that occasion, you can find such  blocks.  I  known
    this is not so great, but I think it can help you a little	bit  (maybe
    in a future version I'll build some code to really check memory leaks).


BUGS:
----
	APurify don't known public memory where a program can read or write
    without having allocated it. Thus, it  will  report  an  error  when  a
    program reads or writes values in a message obtained  through  GetMsg()
    calls. Use AP_Report() to avoid such reports.

	It can display messages about closing the library  without  freeing
    some memory blocks. This is due to printf() that allocates memory  that
    is free'd on exit. This is not a real bug, but you can  avoid  this  by
    doing a AP_Report(0) just before exiting. But you must notice  that  it
    is better to display false bugs than to not display real ones.

	I've rewritten malloc()/realloc()/free().  I  hope  this  will  not
    produce bugs (I've tested sucessfully the test program with  libnix and
    ixemul, so I hope it will be all right).

	Certainly more bugs, but I'm waiting for your bug-reports.
